# Apple-Plant-Disease-Detection-with-AI
Designing and developing an AI model which detects diseased apple plant by image scanning of apple plant leaves. We ran test on the same dateset containing 3,171 images of Apple plant leaves. Then the next step was to give the parameters. We found out our modelâ€™s accuracy changes with slightest change in parameter. The follow table shows different changing which gave our model 98% Accuracy. Techniques like image augmentation, greyscale, masking can affect the efficiency and accuracy of the model. We were ImageNet model and Augmentation helped us in increasing training and testing of the model as original image in Figure 2(A) and its augmented images in Figure 2(B) can be used in training which increases accuracy.
